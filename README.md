## User Experience (UX)
The "Really Deep Photography" website has been designed to offer an intuitive, streamlined user experience for both customers and site administrators. The layout and navigation prioritize ease of use, simplicity, and a minimalist aesthetic, making it straightforward for users to browse photos and make purchases.

### Site Navigation
The website's main navigation bar is present across all pages, offering quick links to essential sections:

- **Home:** A welcoming page that sets the tone for the brand with a hero section introducing the photography service and inviting users to explore the gallery.
- **Gallery:** Users can browse a selection of photos with options to view details and add items to their cart.

- **About and Contact:** These pages provide additional information about the business and a means for users to reach out directly.
- **FAQ:** An FAQ page will provide customers with answers for the most common questions that they may have.
- **Navbar:** The navbar itself uses clear, recognizable icons (like a cart icon) and is fully responsive, making it easy to navigate on both mobile and desktop devices. A user authentication option is available on the navbar, offering a quick login/logout functionality, and an "Admin" link appears for authorized users in the admin group, streamlining access to site management features.

### Visual Design
The color scheme consists primarily of black and white tones, giving the site a sleek, modern look that keeps the focus on the photography content. Typography choices like "Playfair Display" and "Merriweather" provide a professional aesthetic, blending well with the minimalist design. The hero section on the homepage uses bold fonts and a prominent call-to-action button to engage visitors and encourage gallery exploration.

### Interactive Elements
Users can interact with photos through an add-to-cart functionality available on each photo’s detailed view. In the cart, quantity adjustment is straightforward, with plus and minus buttons next to each item, and changes are immediately reflected in the cart. This ensures a seamless shopping experience, with minimal effort required to modify selections.

### Checkout
The checkout process has been simplified to ensure that users can quickly and securely complete their purchases using Stripe, reducing friction in the purchase flow.

### Footer Design
The footer complements the site's aesthetic with a dark background, featuring a Facebook link and a Mailchimp email signup form. The signup form is styled to blend with the footer's design, providing a seamless, attractive appearance.

### Responsiveness and Accessibility
The website has been developed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that content and interactive elements adjust gracefully across devices and screen sizes. The use of clear, high-contrast text and simple layout ensures readability, while form elements are designed for usability on touchscreens as well as desktops.

Overall, "Really Deep Photography" offers an accessible, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate experience that allows users to focus on exploring and purchasing photos with ease.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User {
        int id PK
        string username
        string email
    }

    Cart {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
    }
    CartItem {
        int id PK
        int cart_id FK
        int photo_id FK
        int quantity
    }
    Photo {
        int id PK
        string title
        string description
        string size
        decimal price
        boolean is_featured
    }

    Order {
        int id PK
        string order_number
        string full_name
        string email
        string phone_number
        string country
        string postcode
        string town_or_city
        string street_address1
        string street_address2
        string county
        datetime date
        decimal order_total
        decimal grand_total
        string original_cart
        string stripe_pid
    }

    OrderLineItem {
        int id PK
        int order_id FK
        int photo_id FK
        int quantity
        decimal lineitem_total
    }

    ContactMessage {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        text message
        datetime date_sent
    }

    User ||--o| Cart : "1 has"
    Cart ||--o| CartItem : "1 has many"
    CartItem ||--|| Photo : "1 refers to"
    Order ||--o| OrderLineItem : "1 has many"
    OrderLineItem ||--|| Photo : "1 refers to"
```

I have also used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD, so that my models (CartItem, ContactMessage, Order, OrderLineItem, and Photo) are easier to visualize.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/agile_development/github_project_board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography)](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/issues)

    ![screenshot](documentation/agile_development/open_issues.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography)](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/agile_development/closed_issues.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what photos are on special offer, new photos in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://really-deep-photography-0f99271ef54c.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /accounts/
Disallow: /cart/
Disallow: /checkout/

Sitemap: https://really-deep-photography-0f99271ef54c.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

To illustrate this point, I created a Facebook page for the business.

![screenshot](documentation/facebook/facebook06.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporate a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more. This was set up using MailChimp, for which I have included a link in the technologies used section.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://really-deep-photography-0f99271ef54c.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://really-deep-photography-0f99271ef54c.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or really-deep-photography
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/craigdickerson725/really-deep-photography)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!


### Local VS Deployment

To the best of my knowledge after much testing, I am unaware of any differences that exist between the local site and the deployed site.

## Credits

While the design and layout of Really Deep Photography are largely my own, it must be acknowledged that the functionality of the checkout process using Stripe payments comes from the Code Institute 'Boutique Ado Walkthrough Project' from their Building An E-Commerce Platform course material.  Without these lessons and access to the source code, it would have seemed an insurmountable task to get the payments running smoothly.  It must also be mentioned that the Code Institute Tutor Support helped me get a most annoying bug fixed (which you can find more information about in TESTING.txt).  The modals used on the shopping cart page are based from the basic template found on the Bootstrap website.  The navbar was a variation on code discussed on the W3Schools website.

### Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank my Code Institute mentor, [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) for his support throughout the development of this project.  I have not had the pleasure of meeting any of the other Code Institute mentors, but I can't imagine them being more helpful and supportive than Tim.  Without him, my projects would have all suffered greatly.
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) tutor team for their assistance with troubleshooting and debugging some project issues.  They are a very patient and helpful group, and all us students benefit greatly from their help!
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute Slack community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com) for the moral support; it kept me going during periods of self doubt and impostor syndrome, of which there were many.
- Most importantly, I would like to thank my wife and daughter, who supported me and encouraged me through every single step of this journey. I work hard for them, and hope to make them proud.
